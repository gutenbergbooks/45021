    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A Giant was, I should premise,
     A hulking lout of monstrous size;
     He mostly stood&mdash;I know you 'll laugh&mdash;
     About as high as a giraffe.

     His waist was some three yards in girth:
     When he walked he shook the earth.
     His eyes were of the class called "goggle,"
     Fitter for the scowl than ogle.

     His mouth, decidedly carnivorous,
     Like a shark's,&mdash;the Saints deliver us!
     He yawned like a huge sarcophagus,
     For he was an Anthropophagus,
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And his tusks were huge and craggy;
     His hair, and his brows, and his beard, were shaggy.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I ween on the whole he was aught but a Cupid,
     And exceedingly fierce, and remarkably stupid;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              His brain partaking strongly of lead,
              How well soe'er he was off for head;
              Having frequently one or two
              Crania more than I or you.

              He was bare of arm and leg,
              But buskins had, and a philabeg;
              Also a body-coat of mail
              That shone with steel or brazen scale,
              Like to the back of a crocodile's tail;

                        A crown he wore,
                        And a mace he bore
              That was knobbed and spiked with adamant;
                        It would smash the skull
                        Of the mountain bull,
              Or scatter the brains of the elephant.

         His voice than the tempest was louder and gruffer&mdash;
         Well; so much for the uncouth "buffer."

<pre xml:space="preserve">
               Of a right noble race was Jack,
               For kith and kin he did not lack,
                    Whom tuneful bards have puffed;
               The Seven bold Champions ranked among
               That highly celebrated throng,
                    And Riquet with the Tuft.

    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Jack of the Beanstalk, too, was one;
          And Beauty's Beast; and Valour's son,
              Sir Amadis de Gaul:
          But if I had a thousand tongues,
          A throat of brass, and iron lungs,
              I could not sing them all.

     His sire was a farmer hearty and free;
     He dwelt where the Land's End frowns on the sea,
     And the sea at the Land's End roars again,
     Tit for tat, land and main.

     He was a worthy wight, and so
     He brought up his son in the way he should go;
     He sought not&mdash;not he!&mdash;to make him a "muff;"
     He never taught him a parcel of stuff;

     He bothered him not with trees and plants,
     Nor told him to study the manners of ants.
     He himself had never been
     Bored with the Saturday Magazine;
     The world might be flat, or round, or square,
     He knew not, and he did not care;
     Nor wished that a boy of his should be
     A Cornish "Infant Prodigy."

     But he stored his mind with learning stable,
     The deeds of the Knights of the famed Round Table;
     Legends and stories, chants and lays,
     Of witches and warlocks, goblins and fays;
             How champions of might
             Defended the right,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Freed the captive, and succoured the damsel distrest
              Till Jack would exclaim&mdash;
     "If I don't do the same,
     An' I live to become a man,&mdash;<i>I'm blest!</i>"

     Jack lightly recked of sport or play
              Wherein young gentlemen delight,
     But he would wrestle any day,
     Box, or at backsword fight.

     He was a lad of special "pluck,"
     And strength beyond his years,
          Or science, gave him aye the luck
          To drub his young compeers.

     His task assigned, like Giles or Hodge,
     The woolly flocks to tend,
          His wits to warlike fray or "dodge"
          Wool-gathering oft would wend.

     And then he'd wink his sparkling eye,
     And nod his head right knowingly,
         And sometimes "Won't I just!" would cry,
         Or "At him, Bill, again!"

          Now this behaviour did evince
          A longing for a foe to mince;
          An instinct fitter for a Prince
          Than for a shepherd swain.

          Where good Saint Michael's craggy mount

          In his own view, forsooth, was he;

          In Leicester Square, or Regent Street),
          I mean with respect to his style of hair,
          Mustachios, and beard, and ferocious air,&mdash;
          His figure was quite another affair.

         This odd-looking "bird"
         Was a Richard the Third,
         Four times taller and five as wide;
         Or a clumsy Punch,
         With his cudgel and hunch,
              Into a monster magnified!

     In quest of prey across the sea
     He'd wade, with ponderous club;
              For not the slightest "bones" made he
              Of "boning" people's "grub."
     There was screaming and crying "Oh dear!" and "Oh law

     A spade and a pickaxe he had at his back;
     In his belt a good cow-horn;
     He was up to some game you may safely be sworn.
     Saint Michael's Mount he quickly gained,

     Two! Ha! the plain beneath him crashes:
     Down he goes, full fathoms three.

     "How feel ye now," cried Jack, "old chap?
     It is plain, I wot, to see
     You 're by no means up to trap."
     The Giant answered with such a roar,
     It was like the Atlantic at war with its shore;
     A thousand times worse than the hullaballoo
     Of carnivora, fed,
     Ere going to bed,
     At the Regent's Park, or the Surrey "Zoo."

     "So ho! Sir Giant," said Jack, with a bow,
     "Of breakfast art thou fain?
     For a tit-bit wilt thou broil me now,
     An' I let thee out again? "
     Gnashing his teeth, and rolling his eyes,

     On pantomime rolls all so fiercely fed he,
     And he ate hasty-pudding along with his tea.

     Oh, why starts the monster in terror and fright?
     Why gapes and why stares he when Jack meets his sight?
     Why mutters he wildly, o'ercome with dismay,

     "Toi lol," he answered;&mdash;"well enough:

      Safe and sound o'er leagues of ground
      Jack so merrily capers away,
      Till Arthur's son (he had but one)
      He runs against at the close of day.

      The Prince, you know, was going to blow
      A conjuror's castle about his ears,
      Who bullied there a lady fair,
      And I don't know how many worthy peers.

      Said Jack, "My lord, my trusty sword
      And self at your princely feet I lay;
      'T is my desire to be your squire:"
      His Royal Highness replied "You may."

      The Prince was <i>suave</i>, and comely, and brave,
      And freely scattered his money about;
      "Tipped" every one he met like fun,
      And so he was very soon "cleared out."

      Then he turned to Jack, and cried "Good lack!
      I wonder how we 're to purchase 'grub?'"

          Now night came on, and Arthur's son
             Asked "Where the dickens are we to lodge?"
          "Sir," answered Jack, "your brain do n't rack,
              You may trust to me for a crafty 'dodge:'
          A Giant high lives here hard by;
              The monster I've the pleasure to know:
     Three heads he's got, and would send to pot
              Five hundred men!" The Prince said, "Oh!"
     "My lord," Jack said, "I 'll pledge my head
     To manage the matter completely right.
          In the Giant's nest to-night we 'll rest,
     As sure as a gun, or&mdash;<i>blow me tight!</i>"

          Off scampers Jack, the Prince aback
     With his palfrey waits beneath a rock;

             The Giant within,
             Alarmed at the din,
     Roared out like thunder, "I say, who's there!"

     "Only me," whispered Jack. Cried the Giant, "Who's <i>me?</i>"
     Pitching his voice in a treble key.

         What! an't I a Giant whose heads are three,

         If I tell you a lie never credit me more."
         The Giant replied, "What a deuce of a bore!

                    And, like a good 'feller,'

     Then he cocked his big eye with a playful wink,

     I think I should n't mind a pot;
     But, nunky,&mdash;could you be so kind?-
     I wish I had those traps behind
     The nest wherein you take your nap:-
     That seedy coat and tattered cap;
     That ancient sword, of blade right rusty;
     And those old high-lows all so dusty,
     That look as though for years they'd been
     In pop-shop hung, or store marine;
     No other meed I ask than those,
     So <i>may</i> I have the sword and clothes? "
     "Jack," said the Giant, "yes, you may,
     And let them be a keepsake, pray;
     They 're queer, and would n't suit a 'gent;'
     But what to use is ornament?
     The sword will cut through hardest stuff,
     The cap will make you up to snuff,&mdash;
     Worth something more than 'eight and six,'&mdash;
     The shoes will carry you like 'bricks,'
     At pace outspeeding swiftest stalkers-
     (They were a certain Mr. Walker's);
     The coat excels art's best results,
     Burckhardt outvies, out-Stultzes Stultz;
     No mortal man, whate'er his note,

     To-morrow, or die if you don't guess aright!"

     She poured out a bumper, and drank it up half,

                      That the guests may all
               Enjoy the stirring chase.

     O'er the drawbridge he courses, mid shouts of laughter
     Mac Thundel heavily flounders after,
     Whirling his mace around his head:&mdash;
     The drawbridge groans beneath his tread&mdash;
     It creaks&mdash;it crashes&mdash;he tumbles in,
